Described by some as “America's first gay novel,” *Joseph and His Friend* showcases Taylor's idealized view of the perfect male-male relationship. The other relationships that form within the story entangle and complicate the lives of all involved.

Taylor takes a grim view of city society and their relationship with their country neighbors. Joseph's encounters with many of the city residents reveal them to be uncaring, fake, and greedy. The country town isn't spared criticism, especially for its gossipy and rigid residents. The Reverend Mr. Chaffinch provides an entertaining caricature that simply cannot comprehend Joseph's views on spirituality.

Although Joseph grapples with his spirituality by examining his life's course, his relationship with his male friend is never questioned as being ungodly or wrong.
