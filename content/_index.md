Library Uranian curates out of copyright gay literature, making these historical works freely available to all. In the United States, written works fall out of copyright and into public domain after 95 years, allowing them to be republished, reused, remixed, for whatever purpose. This allows us to make the reading experience better: our goal is to not only curate these often forgotten works, but to improve upon the versions that are currently available online.

The 95 year restriction gives us a look into a time period not often discussed in terms of gay literature. We hope that this material will help readers connect the dots in the journey to gay liberation.
