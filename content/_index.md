Library Uranian curates out of copyright gay literature, bringing these freely available books together in one place. In the United States, written works fall out of copyright and into public domain after 95 years, allowing them to be republished, reused, or remixed for any purpose. This allows us to make the reading experience better: our goal is to not only curate these often forgotten works, but to improve upon the versions that are currently available online.

The 95 year restriction provides a look into a time period not often discussed in terms of gay history. We hope that this material will help readers connect the dots in the journey to gay liberation.
